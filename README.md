### Deployment Strategy
**Avalanche (AVAX) Network Usage**:
- We chose the Avalanche network for deploying our smart contracts due to its rapid transaction processing and lower costs. This choice enhances the efficiency and accessibility of our platform.

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Installation:

**a) Deploy a new contract:**
- Using Foundry :
	1) forge init new_project
  	2) forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts --no-commit
  	3) forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@0.6.1 --no-commit
  	4) Import dNFT.sol and DeployedNFT.s.sol
  	5) Update .env
  	6) forge script script/DeployedNFT.s.sol --rpc-url $FUJI_RPC_URL --private-key $SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --verify --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
  	7) Create a subscription : https://vrf.chain.link/sepolia/ and add a consumer address (Contract address)
  	8) Create a new Upkeep : https://automation.chain.link/sepolia/ and use Custom logic
  	9) Create a new Upkeep with Time-based to call updateBetScore(0)
  	10) Setup CCIP :
  	      1) Deploy Receiver Contract (dNFT) : 0x554472a2720e5e7d5d3c817529aba05eed5f82d8 (ROUTER FUJI)
  	      2) Deploy Sender Contract : 0xD0daae2231E9CB96b94C8512223533293C3693Bf (ROUTER SEPOLIA), 0x779877A7B0D9E8603169DdbD7836e478b4624789 (LINK SEPOLIA) and write on it the receiver address.
  	      3) Fund with link the Sender Contract
  	      4) You can stack your token. Just verify 14767482510784806043 (Chain selector Fuji)
